# Package io.github.hnosmium0001.cute.viewmodel.signal

This package contains definitions for the Signals and Slots (abbreviated as S.S.) mechanism
for *cute*.

Signals and slots are inspired by Qt's mechanism with the same name, and it's widely used
in OOP environments as the way to manage events and event handlers.
